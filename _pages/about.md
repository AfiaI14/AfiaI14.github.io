## Hi, I'm Afia 👋

I'm a full-stack data scientist with **4+ years of experience** in FinTech and AI consultancy,
specialising in **NLP, RAG pipelines, fraud detection, and MLOps**. I love turning messy,
real-world data into production-grade AI systems that actually move the needle for businesses.

Recently completed my **Master's thesis at Fraunhofer FOKUS**, researched how structured
knowledge bases can be injected directly into LLaMA's transformer attention mechanisms to
improve reasoning and open-ended question answering.

### What I've Built

At **Publicis Sapient** (Berlin) I designed and shipped a cloud-native multi-agent system
using LLMs and LangGraph that automated complex enterprise documentation workflows. I've also built RAG chatbots with
Azure Cognitive Search, Graph RAG pipelines with knowledge graph embeddings, and
dynamic pricing & churn prediction models on Databricks.

Before that, at **SSL Wireless** (Dhaka) I led end-to-end ML projects across fraud
detection, transaction monitoring, OCR-based KYC, and Bengali speech-to-text.

### Research

**Master's Thesis — Fraunhofer FOKUS / Freie Universität Berlin** *(2024–2025)*

*Integrating Structured Knowledge Bases into LLM Attention Mechanisms*

Fine-tuning a LLaMA-based model using a KBLAM-inspired architecture that injects
structured knowledge entries directly into transformer attention layers — enabling
improved reasoning without the latency overhead of traditional retrieval.

### Outside of Work

When I'm not building models you'll find me competing on Kaggle — I ranked **6th out of
59 teams** in the Bengali Automatic Speech Recognition competition at BUET CSE Fest 2022,
and placed in the **top 12%** of the U.S. Patent Phrase Matching competition.
